<p>Hello, it&rsquo;s me <br>
I was wondering if after all these years you&rsquo;d like to meet <br>
To go over everything <br>
They say that time&rsquo;s supposed to heal ya <br>
But I ain&rsquo;t done much healing <br></p>

<p>Hello, can you hear me <br>
I&rsquo;m in California dreaming about who we used to be <br>
When we were younger and free <br>
I&rsquo;ve forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet <br></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s such a difference between us <br>
And a million miles <br></p>

<p>Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for everything that I&rsquo;ve done
But when I call you never seem to be home</p>

<p>Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I&rsquo;ve tried
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don&rsquo;t matter it clearly doesn&rsquo;t tear you apart anymore</p>

<p>Hello, how are you?
It&rsquo;s so typical of me to talk about myself I&rsquo;m sorry
I hope that you&rsquo;re well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time</p>

<p>So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for everything that I&rsquo;ve done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I&rsquo;ve tried
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don&rsquo;t matter it clearly doesn&rsquo;t tear you apart anymore</p>

<p>Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore</p>

<p>Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for everything that I&rsquo;ve done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I&rsquo;ve tried
To tell you I&rsquo;m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don&rsquo;t matter it clearly doesn&rsquo;t tear you apart anymore
