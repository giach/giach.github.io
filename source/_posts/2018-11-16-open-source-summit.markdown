I'm really excited to talk about my first important conference attendance. This year, the Open Source Summit conference took place in Edinburgh on 22-24th of October.

The conference was a great place to meet amazing people and to share ideas.

I had the opportunity to be part of the "Panel Discussion: Outreachy Linux Kernel Internship Report", moderated by Julia Lawall, the coordinator of the program. My presentation was about my work at the ADS1118 sensor. At the end of the talk, there was an open discussion about how to encourage women to contribute to open source projects.

One of my favourite presentations was the one given by Greg Kroah-Hartman, a Linux kernel maintainer and an amazing speaker. He talked about Meltdown and Specter, two of the most critical security vulnerabilities and their impact to Linux kernel.

Steven Rostedt, a remarkable Linux kernel contributor and developer at VMWare, gave an outstanding talk about Dynamic Kernel Tracing Events.

Edinburgh is an amazing and historical city. There are a lot of famous places like Edinburgh Castle, Old Town, Princes Street. We visited Edinburgh Castle in the evening. And the view on top of the castle took our breath away.
